The Greedy algorithms were much faster than the exhaustive algorithms. For both knapsack and color graph, our algorithms finished finding solutions in under one second. For knapsack we felt that the greediest approach was to sort the knapsack items by a made up parameter that we call ROI (return on investment). Something with a high ROI would be an item with a low cost and a high value, ie. Cost = 2, Value = 100. Something with a low ROI would have high cost and low value, ie. cost = 50, Value = 4. The result helped us pick items that cost little and provided a lot. Are algorithm has a low complexity,nlogn, which is the complexity of the quicksort that organizes the items by ROI. In the second algorithm, we had little success improving our algorithm by sorting nodes by degree. So we decided to choose nodes based on their current conflicts. This results in an extremely low complexity of n, however, we are not very confident in our results being very optimal.
